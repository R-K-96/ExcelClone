You can use CSS to hide the color input and display icons instead. Here's an example:

HTML:


<label>
  <input type="color" name="color" id="color" />
  <span class="icon"></span>
</label>


CSS:


label {
  position: relative;
}

input[type="color"] {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  opacity: 0;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.icon {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
  background: #ccc;
  /* use your icon image here */
}


In this example, the label element contains both the input and the span elements. 
The position: relative style on the label is necessary to make the position: absolute 
style on the input element work properly.

The input[type="color"] element is positioned absolutely and set to opacity: 0, 
which hides it from view. The cursor: pointer style is added to make the icon clickable.

The span.icon element is the icon that will be displayed instead of the color input. 
You can use your own icon image by setting the background style.

Note that this method will only work if the user has a browser that supports the input[type="color"] element. 
If the user's browser does not support it, they will see a normal text input instead.
